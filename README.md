# Canoa_de_Tolda_Sao_Francisco_Map
QGIS map of the lower Sao Francisco River Valley

## Instructions
If you don't know how to use Git, push the green Code dropdown, select ```Download ZIP```, and extract the folder onto your hard drive in a sensible location. Do not move any files around within the folder, or the map may break. Open the Canoa_de_Tolda_Sao_Francisco.qgz file in QGIS; it should work as long as you have a reasonably updated version of QGIS.

If you _do_ know how to use Git but just want to see the map, cloe the repo and do the same as above.

If you know how to use Git and want to modify/contribute to the map, _fork_ the repo on your own GitHub account, clone it to your local computer from your fork, and make all modifications you like. Add data, change styling, whatever. Try not to add enormous files (>200MB) because they'll slow GitHub down a lot. When you're ready, commit to your fork and make a pull request to this upstream repo!
